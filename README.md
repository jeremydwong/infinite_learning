### Project: Simulations that demonstrate how to perform optimization for human movement experiments. I emphasize solving for movement time as a decision variable, and typically am interested in energy in the objective. 

Using InfiniteOpt, demonstrate Energy+Time power laws in eye movements, reaching, walking.
